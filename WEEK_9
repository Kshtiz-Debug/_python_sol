Problem: WEEK9_PPA1_not_graded
Write a recursive function named triangular that accepts a positive integer nn as argument and returns the sum of the first nn positive integers.
You do not have to accept input from the user or print the output to the console. You just have to write the function definition.


Code:

def triangular(n):
    if n>0:
        return n+triangular(n-1)
    else:
        return n



Problem: WEEK9_PPA2_not_graded
The factorial of a positive integer nn is defined as follows:
n!=1⋅2⋅3⋯nn!=1⋅2⋅3⋯n
Write a recursive function named factorial that accepts a positive integer nn as argument and returns the factorial of nn.
You do not have to accept input from the user or print the output to the console. You just have to write the function definition.


Code:

def factorial(n):
    if n>1:
        return n*factorial(n-1)
    else:
        return 1


Problem:WEEK9_PPA3_not_graded
Write a recursive function named multiply accepts two positive integers aa and bb as argument and returns their product. You can only use ++ and −− operators. You are not allowed to use the ∗∗ symbol anywhere in your code!
You do not have to accept input from the user or print the output to the console. You just have to write the function definition.


Code:

def multiply(a, b):
    if a==0 or b==0:
        return 0
    elif b>0:
        return a+multiply(a,b-1)
    else:
        return -(multiply(a,-b))
