Problem: WEEK9_PPA1_not_graded
Write a recursive function named triangular that accepts a positive integer nn as argument and returns the sum of the first nn positive integers.
You do not have to accept input from the user or print the output to the console. You just have to write the function definition.


Code:

def triangular(n):
    if n>0:
        return n+triangular(n-1)
    else:
        return n
